Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy"). He was born in [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels"), which was then part of the [Habsburg Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Netherlands "Habsburg Netherlands"). He was a professor at the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua "University of Padua") and later became Imperial physician at the court of [Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor").

## Early life and education

* Vesalius was born on 31 December 1514 in Brussels, which was then part of the [Habsburg Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Netherlands "Habsburg Netherlands").
* His father encouraged him to continue in the family tradition and enrolled him in the [Brethren of the Common Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life "Brethren of the Common Life") in Brussels to learn Greek and Latin prior to learning medicine, according to standards of the era.
* He then decided to pursue a career in the military at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris "University of Paris"), where he relocated in 1533. There he studied the theories of [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") under the auspices of [Jacques Dubois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dubois "Jacques Dubois") (Jacobus Sylvius) and [Jean Fernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Fernel "Jean Fernel"). It was during this time that he developed an interest in anatomy, and he was often found examining excavated bones in the [charnel houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnel_house "Charnel house") at the [Cemetery of the Innocents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimeti%C3%A8re_des_Innocents "Cimetière des Innocents").
* He completed his studies at [Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuven "Leuven") under [Johann Winter von Andernach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Winter_von_Andernach "Johann Winter von Andernach") and graduated the following year. His thesis (for the treatment of indiidual body parts) was a commentary on the ninth book of [Rhazes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi "Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi").
* He then shifted to [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice") in 1536 and moved to the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua "University of Padua") (*Universitas artistarum*) to study for his [medical doctorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_doctorate "Medical doctorate"), which he received in 1537.

## Medical career and accomplishments

* On the day of his graduation he was immediately offered the chair of surgery and anatomy (*explicator chirurgiae*) at [Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua "Padua"). He also guest-lectured at the [University of Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna "University of Bologna") and the [University of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pisa "University of Pisa").
* Prior to taking up his position in Padua, Vesalius traveled through Italy, and assisted the future [Pope Paul IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_IV "Pope Paul IV") and [Ignatius of Loyola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola "Ignatius of Loyola") to heal those afflicted by [leprosy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy").
* In Venice, he met the illustrator [Johan van Calcar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_van_Calcar "Jan van Calcar"), a student of Titian. It was with van Calcar that Vesalius published his first anatomical text, *Tabulae Anatomicae Sex*, in 1538.
* Vesalius performed dissection as the primary teaching tool, handling the actual work himself and urging students to perform dissection themselves. He considered hands-on direct observation to be the only reliable resource.
* Vesalius created detailed illustrations of anatomy for students in the form of six large woodcut posters. When he found that some of them were being widely copied, he published them all in 1538 under the title *Tabulae anatomicae sex*. He followed this in 1539 with an updated version of Winter's anatomical handbook, *Institutiones anatomicae.*
* In 1539 he also published his [Venesection letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Venesection_letter&action=edit&redlink=1 "Venesection letter (page does not exist)") on [bloodletting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting "Bloodletting"). This was a popular treatment for almost any illness.
* In 1543, Vesalius conducted a public dissection of the body of Jakob Karrer von Gebweiler, a notorious felon from the city of [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel "Basel"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"). He assembled and articulated the bones, finally donating the [skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") to the [University of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel "University of Basel"). This preparation ("The Basel Skeleton") is Vesalius' only well-preserved skeletal preparation, and also the world's oldest surviving anatomical preparation. It is still displayed at the Anatomical Museum of the [University of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel "University of Basel").
* In the same year Vesalius took residence in Basel to help [Johannes Oporinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Oporinus "Johannes Oporinus") publish the seven-volume *[De humani corporis fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")* (*On the fabric of the human body*), a groundbreaking work of [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy"). That work, now collectively referred to as the [Fabrica of Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica"), was groundbreaking in the history of medical publishing and is considered to be a major step in the development of scientific medicine. Vesalius was 28 years old when the first edition of *Fabrica* was published.

## Imperial physician and death

* Soon after publication, Vesalius was invited to become imperial physician to the court of [Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor"). Vesalius took up the offered position in the imperial court, where he had to deal with other physicians who mocked him for being a mere [barber surgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_surgeon "Barber surgeon") instead of an academic working on the respected basis of theory.
* In the 1540s, shortly after entering in service of the emperor, Vesalius married Anne van Hamme, from Vilvorde, Belgium. They had one daughter, named Anne, who died in 1588.
* Over the next eleven years Vesalius traveled with the court, treating injuries caused in battle or tournaments, performing postmortems, administering medication, and writing private letters addressing specific medical questions. During these years he also wrote *the Epistle on the China root*, a short text on the properties of a medical plant whose efficacy he doubted, as well as a defense of his anatomical findings.
* After the abdication of Emperor Charles V, Vesalius continued at court in great favor with his son Philip II, who rewarded him with a pension for life by making him a [count palatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_palatine "Count palatine"). In 1555 he published a revised edition of *De humani corporis fabrica*.
* In 1564 Vesalius went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, some said, in penance after being accused of dissecting a living body. He sailed with the Venetian fleet under [James Malatesta](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Malatesta "it:Giacomo Malatesta") via [Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus "Cyprus"). When he reached [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") he received a message from the Venetian senate requesting him again to accept the Paduan professorship, which had become vacant on the death of his friend and pupil [Fallopius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Falloppio "Gabriele Falloppio").
* After struggling for many days with adverse winds in the [Ionian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea "Ionian Sea"), he was shipwrecked on the island of [Zakynthos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakynthos "Zakynthos").\[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius#cite_note-NPO-9) Here he soon died, in such debt that a benefactor kindly paid for his funeral. At the time of his death he was 49 years of age. He was buried somewhere on the island of Zakynthos (Zante).

## `Publications`

### *De Humani Corporis Fabrica*

* In 1543, Vesalius asked [Johannes Oporinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Oporinus "Johannes Oporinus") to publish the book *[De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septem](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=De_Humani_Corporis_Fabrica_Libri_Septem&action=edit&redlink=1 "De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septem (page does not exist)")* (*On the fabric of the human body*), a groundbreaking work of [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy") he dedicated to Charles V and which many believe was illustrated by [Titian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian "Titian")'s pupil [Jan Stephen van Calcar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Van_Calcar "Jan Van Calcar").
* About the same time he published another version of his great work, entitled *De humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome* (*Abridgement of the Structure of the Human Body*) more commonly known as the *Epitome*, with a stronger focus on illustrations than on text, so as to help readers, including medical students, to easily understand his findings. The actual text of the *Epitome* was an abridged form of his work in the *Fabrica*, and the organization of the two books was quite varied. He dedicated it to [Philip II of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain "Philip II of Spain"), son of the Emperor.

  > Vesalius's *Fabrica* contained many intricately detailed drawings of human dissections, often in allegorical poses.
* The *Fabrica* emphasized the priority of dissection and what has come to be called the "[anatomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical "Anatomical")" view of the body.
* His book contains drawings of several organs on two leaves. This allows for the creation of three-dimensional diagrams by cutting out the organs and pasting them on flayed figures.
* Besides the first good description of the [sphenoid bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone "Sphenoid bone"), he showed that the [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum "Human sternum") consists of three portions and the [sacrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum "Sacrum") of five or six, and described accurately the [vestibule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_of_the_ear "Vestibule of the ear") in the interior of the [temporal bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone "Temporal bone").
* He not only verified [Estienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Estienne "Charles Estienne")'s observations on the valves of the [hepatic veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_veins "Hepatic veins"), but also described the [vena azygos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vena_azygos "Vena azygos"), and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named the [ductus venosus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_venosus "Ductus venosus").
* He described the [omentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum "Greater omentum") and its connections with the stomach, the [spleen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen "Spleen") and the [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy) "Colon (anatomy)"); gave the first correct views of the structure of the [pylorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus "Pylorus"); observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first good account of the [mediastinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum) and [pleura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleura "Pleura") and the fullest description of the anatomy of the brain up to that time. He did not understand the inferior recesses, and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth, and the fifth as the seventh.
* In this work, Vesalius also becomes the first person to describe [mechanical ventilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation "Mechanical ventilation").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius#cite_note-Resuscitation-13) It is largely this achievement that has resulted in Vesalius being incorporated into the [Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_and_New_Zealand_College_of_Anaesthetists "Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists") college arms and crest.

#### Excerpts

* When I undertake the dissection of a human pelvis I pass a stout rope tied like a noose beneath the lower jaw and through the [zygomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_arch "Zygomatic arch") up to the top of the head... The lower end of the noose I run through a pulley fixed to a beam in the room so that I may raise or lower the cadaver as it hangs there or turn around in any direction to suit my purpose; ... You must take care not to put the noose around the neck, unless some of the muscles connected to the [occipital bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_bone "Occipital bone") have already been cut away.

#### Other publications

* In 1538, Vesalius wrote *Epistola, docens venam axillarem dextri cubiti in dolore laterali secandam* (A letter, teaching that in cases of pain in the side, the axillary vein of the right elbow be cut), commonly known as the Venesection Letter, which demonstrated a revived [venesection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venesection "Venesection"), a classical procedure in which blood was drawn near the site of the ailment. He sought to locate the precise site for venesection in [pleurisy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy "Pleurisy") within the framework of the classical method.
* The real significance of the book is his attempt to support his arguments by the location and continuity of the [venous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venous_system "Venous system") from his observations rather than appeal to earlier published works. With this novel approach to the problem of venesection, Vesalius posed the then striking hypothesis that anatomical dissection might be used to test speculation.
* In 1546, three years after the *Fabrica*, he wrote his *Epistola rationem modumque propinandi radicis Chynae decocti*, commonly known as the Epistle on the China Root. Ostensibly an appraisal of a popular but ineffective treatment for gout, syphilis, and stone, this work is especially important as a continued polemic against Galenism and a reply to critics in the camp of his former professor Jacobus Sylvius, now an obsessive detractor.
* In February 1561, Vesalius was given a copy of Gabriele Fallopio's *Observationes anatomicae*, friendly additions and corrections to the Fabrica. Before the end of the year Vesalius composed a cordial reply, *Anatomicarum Gabrielis Fallopii observationum examen*, generally referred to as the *Examen*. In this work he recognizes in Fallopio a true equal in the science of dissection he had done so much to create. Vesalius' reply to Fallopio was published in May 1564, a month after Vesalius' death on the Greek island of [Zante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zante "Zante") (now called [Zakynthos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakynthos "Zakynthos")).

## `Scientific Findings`

### Skeletal system

* Vesalius believed the [skeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_system "Skeletal system") to be the framework of the human body. It was in this opening chapter or book of *[De fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")* that Vesalius made several of his strongest claims against [Galen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") theories and writings which he had put in his anatomy books. In his extensive study of the skull, Vesalius claimed that the [mandible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible "Human mandible") consisted of one bone, whereas Galen had thought it to be two separate bones. He accurately described the [vestibule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_of_the_ear "Vestibule of the ear") in the interior of the [temporal bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone "Temporal bone") of the skull.
* In [Galen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") observation of the ape, he had discovered that their [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum "Sternum") consisted of seven parts which he assumed also held true for humans. Vesalius discovered that the [human sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum "Human sternum") consisted of only three parts.
* He also disproved the common belief that men had one rib fewer than women and noted that the [fibula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula "Fibula") and [tibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia "Tibia") bones of the leg were indeed larger than the [humerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus "Humerus") bone of the arm, unlike [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen")'s original findings.

### Muscular System

* Vesalius' most impressive contribution to the study of the [muscular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_system "Muscular system") may be the illustrations that accompany the text in *De fabrica*, which would become known as the "muscle men". He describes the source and position of each muscle of the body and provides information on their respective operation.

### Vascular and Circulatory Systems

* Vesalius' work on the [vascular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular "Vascular") and [circulatory systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system "Circulatory system") was his greatest contribution to modern medicine. In his dissections of the heart, Vesalius became convinced that Galen's claims of a porous [Interventricular septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum "Interventricular septum") were false. This fact was previously described by [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus "Michael Servetus"), a fellow of Vesalius, but never reached the public.
* In the second edition Vesalius published that the septum was indeed waterproof, discovering (and naming), the [mitral valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve "Mitral valve") to explain the blood flow.
* Vesalius believed that [cardiac systole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine) "Systole (medicine)") is synchronous with the [arterial pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(anatomy) "Pulse (anatomy)").
* He not only verified [Estienne's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Estienne "Charles Estienne") findings on the valves of the [hepatic veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_veins "Hepatic veins"), but also described the [azygos vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azygos_vein "Azygos vein"), and discovered the canal which passes into the fetus between the [umbilical vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_vein "Umbilical vein") and [vena cava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vena_cava "Vena cava").

### Nervous System

* Vesalius defined a nerve as the mode of transmitting sensation and motion and thus refuted his contemporaries' claims that [ligaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament "Ligament"), [tendons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon "Tendon") and [aponeuroses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aponeuroses "Aponeuroses") were three types of nerve units.
* He believed that the brain and the nervous system are the center of the mind and emotion in contrast to the common [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism "Aristotelianism") belief that the heart was the center of the body. He correspondingly believed that nerves themselves do not originate from the heart, but from the brain.
* Upon studying the [optic nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve "Optic nerve"), Vesalius came to the conclusion that nerves were not hollow.

### Abdominal Organs

* In *De fabrica*, he corrected an earlier claim he made in *Tabulae* about the right kidney being set higher than the left. Vesalius claimed that the kidneys were not a filter device for urine to pass through, but rather that the kidneys serve to filter blood as well, and that excretions from the kidneys travelled through the [ureters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureters "Ureters") to the bladder.
* He described the [omentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum "Greater omentum"), and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon gave the first correct views of the structure of the [pylorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus "Pylorus").
* He also observed the small size of the [caecal appendix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_(human) "Appendix (human)") in man and gave the first good account of the [mediastinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum "Mediastinum") and [pleura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleura "Pleura").
* Vesalius admitted that due to a lack of pregnant cadavers he was unable to come to a significant understanding of the reproductive organs. However, he did find that the uterus had been falsely identified as having two distinct sections.

### Heart

* Through his work with muscles, Vesalius believed that a criterion for muscles was their voluntary motion. On this claim, he deduced that the heart was not a true muscle due to the obvious involuntary nature of its motion.
* He identified two chambers and two atria. The [right atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium "Right atrium") was considered a continuation of the [inferior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava "Inferior vena cava") and [superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava "Superior vena cava") [venae cavae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae "Venae cavae"), and the [left atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium "Left atrium") was considered a continuation of the [pulmonary vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_vein "Pulmonary vein").
* He also addressed the controversial issue of the heart being the centre of the soul. He wished to avoid drawing any conclusions due to possible conflict with contemporary religious beliefs.
* Against Galen's theory and many beliefs he also discovered that there was no hole in the [septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum "Septum") or [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart "Heart").

### Other Achievements

* Vesalius disproved Galen's assertion that men have more teeth than women.\[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius#cite_note-NPO-9)
* Vesalius introduced the notion of induction of the extraction of [empyema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyema "Empyema") through surgical means.
* Due to his impressive study of the human skull and the variations in its features he is said to have been responsible for the launch of the study of [physical anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_anthropology "Physical anthropology").
* Vesalius always encouraged his students to check their findings, and even his own findings, so that they could better understand the structure of the human body.
* In addition to his continual efforts to study anatomy he also worked on medicinal remedies and came to such conclusions as treating [syphilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis "Syphilis") with [chinaroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinaroot "Chinaroot").
* Vesalius claimed that medicine had three aspects: drugs, diet, and 'the use of hands'—mainly suggesting surgery and the knowledge of anatomy and physiology gained through dissection.
* Vesalius was a supporter of 'parallel dissections' in which an animal cadaver and a human cadaver are dissected simultaneously in order to demonstrate the anatomical differences and thus correct Galenic errors.

## `Scientific and Historical Impact`

* The influence of Vesalius' plates representing the partial dissections of the human figure posing in a landscape setting is apparent in the anatomical plates prepared by the Baroque painter [Pietro da Cortona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_da_Cortona "Pietro da Cortona") (1596–1669), who executed anatomical plates with figures in dramatic poses, most of them with architectural or landscape backdrops.
* During the 20th century, the American artist, [Jacob Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lawrence "Jacob Lawrence") created his *Vesalius Suite* based on the anatomical drawings of Andreas Vesalius.

  > "*De Fabrica* received a mixed reception when it first appeared; strict Galenists deplored its attacks on their master, while other anatomists, particularly in Italy, praised it as an important contribution—the reaction that was ultimately to carry the day," concludes Katharine Park her Commentary in the 1998 De Fabrica.
* Vesalius was going up against the towering authority of a tradition stretching back to the ancients—here specifically the work of [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") – with only his experience on his side. He knew what his eyes saw and his hands felt, and concluded that traditional belief was wrong.

  > His guarantee: if you doubt what I say and show here, do your own anatomy, see for yourself.
* Vesalius's work was also part of one of the earliest known public health programs. The Council of Doges in Venice responded to the Bubonic Plague in the mid-14th century by directing the University of Padua Medical School to devote itself to discovering the causes of plague, how it spreads, how it develops in the individual, and if possible how victims might be cured. It ultimately took three centuries to find the solution, but with Venice leading the way plague was eventually eliminated as a major killer across Europe.
