Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy"). He was born in [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels"), which was then part of the [Habsburg Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Netherlands "Habsburg Netherlands"). He was a professor at the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua "University of Padua") and later became Imperial physician at the court of [Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor").

## Early life and education

* Vesalius was born on 31 December 1514 in Brussels, which was then part of the [Habsburg Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Netherlands "Habsburg Netherlands").
* In 1533, at Paris, he studied the theories of [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") under the guidance of [Jacques Dubois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dubois "Jacques Dubois") and [Jean Fernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Fernel "Jean Fernel"). He was often found examining excavated bones in the [charnel houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnel_house "Charnel house") at the [Cemetery of the Innocents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimeti%C3%A8re_des_Innocents "Cimetière des Innocents").
* He completed his studies at [Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuven "Leuven") and graduated. His **thesis (Treatment of individual body parts)** was a commentary on the ninth book of [Rhazes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi "Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi").
* He then shifted to [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice") in 1536 and moved to the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua "University of Padua") to study for his [medical doctorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_doctorate "Medical doctorate"), which he received in 1537.

## Medical career and achievements

* On the day of his graduation he was immediately **offered the chair of surgery** and anatomy at [Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua "Padua"). He also **guest-lectured** at the [University of Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna "University of Bologna") and the [University of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pisa "University of Pisa").
* He assisted [Pope Paul IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_IV "Pope Paul IV") and [Ignatius of Loyola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola "Ignatius of Loyola") to **heal people affected by [leprosy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy").**
* Vesalius **performed dissection as the primary teaching tool**. He considered hands-on direct observation to be the best method of learning.
* In Venice,Vesalius **published his first anatomical text, *Tabulae Anatomicae Sex***, in 1538. Then in 1539 he published an **updated version** of Winter's anatomical handbook, ***Institutiones anatomicae.***
* In 1539 he **also published his [Venesection letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Venesection_letter&action=edit&redlink=1 "Venesection letter (page does not exist)") on [bloodletting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting "Bloodletting").** This was a popular treatment for almost any illness.
* In 1543, Vesalius conducted a **public dissection** in the city of [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel "Basel"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"). He assembled and articulated the bones, finally donating the [skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") to the [University of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel "University of Basel"). It is **still displayed at the Anatomical Museum of the [University of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel "University of Basel").**

## Imperial physician and death

* Soon after publication, Vesalius became the imperial physician of the court of [Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor") in Spain.
* In the 1540s, Vesalius married Anne van Hamme, from Vilvorde, Belgium. They had one daughter, named Anne, who died in 1588.
* Over the next eleven years Vesalius traveled with the court..

  * **treating injuries caused in battle or tournaments**
  * **performing postmortems &** 
  * **administering medication**
* The king Philip II (son of Charles V) rewarded him with a **pension for life** by making him a [count palatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_palatine "Count palatine").
* In 1555 he published a **revised edition of *De humani corporis fabrica*.**
* In 1564 Vesalius went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. After struggling for many days with adverse winds in the [Ionian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea "Ionian Sea"), he was shipwrecked on the island of [Zakynthos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakynthos "Zakynthos") and died at an early age of 49.

## `Publications`

### *De Humani Corporis Fabrica*



* In 1543, Vesalius published the seven-volume *[De humani corporis fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")* (T*he fabric of human body*), now referred as [Fabrica of Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica"). Vesalius was 28 years old when the first edition of *Fabrica* was published.
* During the same time, he also published *De humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome (*commonly known ***the Epitome**)*, with a stronger focus on illustrations than on text.
* His book contains drawings of several organs on two leaves and three-dimensional diagrams by cutting out the organs and pasting them on flayed figures.
* He very well described [sphenoid bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone "Sphenoid bone"). He showed that the [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum "Human sternum") consists of three portions and the [sacrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum "Sacrum") consists of five or six portions.
* He observed the valves of the [hepatic veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_veins "Hepatic veins"), and described the [vena azygos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vena_azygos "Vena azygos"). He also discovered the [ductus venosus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_venosus "Ductus venosus").
* He described the [omentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum "Greater omentum") and its connections with the stomach, the [spleen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen "Spleen") and the [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy) "Colon (anatomy)").

  * He gave the first correct view of the structure of the [pylorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus "Pylorus"), [mediastinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum) and [pleura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleura "Pleura")
  * Observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man
  * He gave the fullest description of the anatomy of the brain in that time.
  * He did not understand the inferior recesses, and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth, and the fifth as the seventh.
* Vesalius is also the first person to describe [mechanical ventilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation "Mechanical ventilation").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius#cite_note-Resuscitation-13)

#### Other publications

* In 1538, Vesalius wrote *Epistola, docens venam axillarem dextri cubiti in dolore laterali secandam* commonly known as the Venesection Letter.
* In 1546, three years after the *Fabrica*, he wrote his *Epistola rationem modumque propinandi radicis Chynae decocti*, commonly known as the Epistle on the China Root.

## `Scientific Findings`

### Skeletal system

* Vesalius believed the [skeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_system "Skeletal system") to be the framework of the human body. It was in this opening chapter or book of *[De fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")* that Vesalius made several of his **strongest claims against [Galen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") theories** and writings which he had put in his anatomy books. In his extensive study of the skull, Vesalius claimed that the [mandible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible "Human mandible") consisted of one bone, whereas Galen had thought it to be two separate bones. He accurately described the [vestibule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_of_the_ear "Vestibule of the ear") in the interior of the [temporal bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone "Temporal bone") of the skull.
* In [Galen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") observation of the ape, he had discovered that their [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum "Sternum") consisted of seven parts which he assumed also held true for humans. Vesalius discovered that the [human sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum "Human sternum") consisted of only three parts.
* He also disproved the common belief that men had one rib fewer than women and noted that the [fibula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula "Fibula") and [tibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia "Tibia") bones of the leg were indeed larger than the [humerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus "Humerus") bone of the arm, unlike [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen")'s original findings.

### Muscular System

* Vesalius' contribution to [muscular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_system "Muscular system") came to be known as the **"muscle men"**. He describes the **source and position of each muscle** of the body and provides information on their respective operation.

### Vascular and Circulatory Systems

* Vesalius' work on the [vascular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular "Vascular") and [circulatory systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system "Circulatory system") was his greatest contribution to modern medicine. In his dissections of the heart, Vesalius became convinced that Galen's claims of a porous [Interventricular septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interventricular_septum "Interventricular septum") were false. This fact was previously described by [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus "Michael Servetus"), a fellow of Vesalius, but never reached the public.
* In the second edition Vesalius published that the septum was indeed waterproof, discovering (and naming), the [mitral valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve "Mitral valve") to explain the blood flow.
* Vesalius believed that [cardiac systole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine) "Systole (medicine)") is synchronous with the [arterial pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(anatomy) "Pulse (anatomy)").
* He not only verified [Estienne's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Estienne "Charles Estienne") findings on the valves of the [hepatic veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_veins "Hepatic veins"), but also described the [azygos vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azygos_vein "Azygos vein"), and discovered the canal which passes into the fetus between the [umbilical vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_vein "Umbilical vein") and [vena cava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vena_cava "Vena cava").

### Nervous System

* Vesalius defined a nerve as the mode of transmitting sensation and motion and thus refuted his contemporaries' claims that [ligaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament "Ligament"), [tendons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon "Tendon") and [aponeuroses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aponeuroses "Aponeuroses") were three types of nerve units.
* He believed that the brain and the nervous system are the center of the mind and emotion in contrast to the common [Aristotelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelianism "Aristotelianism") belief that the heart was the center of the body. He correspondingly believed that nerves themselves do not originate from the heart, but from the brain.
* Upon studying the [optic nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve "Optic nerve"), Vesalius came to the conclusion that nerves were not hollow.

### Abdominal Organs

* In *De fabrica*, he corrected an earlier claim he made in *Tabulae* about the right kidney being set higher than the left. Vesalius claimed that the kidneys were not a filter device for urine to pass through, but rather that the kidneys serve to filter blood as well, and that excretions from the kidneys travelled through the [ureters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureters "Ureters") to the bladder.
* He described the [omentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum "Greater omentum"), and its connections with the stomach, the spleen and the colon gave the first correct views of the structure of the [pylorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus "Pylorus").
* He also observed the small size of the [caecal appendix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_(human) "Appendix (human)") in man and gave the first good account of the [mediastinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum "Mediastinum") and [pleura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleura "Pleura").
* Vesalius admitted that due to a lack of pregnant cadavers he was unable to come to a significant understanding of the reproductive organs. However, he did find that the uterus had been falsely identified as having two distinct sections.

### Heart

* Through his work with muscles, Vesalius believed that a criterion for muscles was their voluntary motion. On this claim, he deduced that the heart was not a true muscle due to the obvious involuntary nature of its motion.
* He identified two chambers and two atria. The [right atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium "Right atrium") was considered a continuation of the [inferior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava "Inferior vena cava") and [superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava "Superior vena cava") [venae cavae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae "Venae cavae"), and the [left atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium "Left atrium") was considered a continuation of the [pulmonary vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_vein "Pulmonary vein").
* He also addressed the controversial issue of the heart being the centre of the soul. He wished to avoid drawing any conclusions due to possible conflict with contemporary religious beliefs.
* Against Galen's theory and many beliefs he also discovered that there was no hole in the [septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum "Septum") or [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart "Heart").

### Other Achievements

* Vesalius disproved Galen's assertion that men have more teeth than women.
* Vesalius introduced the notion of induction of the extraction of [empyema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyema "Empyema") through surgical means.
* Due to his impressive study of the human skull and the variations in its features he is said to have been responsible for the launch of the study of [physical anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_anthropology "Physical anthropology").
* Vesalius always encouraged his students to check their findings, and even his own findings, so that they could better understand the structure of the human body.
* In addition to his continual efforts to study anatomy he also worked on medicinal remedies and came to such conclusions as treating [syphilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis "Syphilis") with [chinaroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinaroot "Chinaroot").
* Vesalius claimed that medicine had three aspects: drugs, diet, and 'the use of hands'—mainly suggesting surgery and the knowledge of anatomy and physiology gained through dissection.
* Vesalius was a supporter of 'parallel dissections' in which an animal cadaver and a human cadaver are dissected simultaneously in order to demonstrate the anatomical differences and thus correct Galenic errors.

## `Scientific and Historical Impact`

* The influence of Vesalius' plates representing the partial dissections of the human figure posing in a landscape setting is apparent in the anatomical plates prepared by the Baroque painter [Pietro da Cortona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_da_Cortona "Pietro da Cortona") (1596–1669), who executed anatomical plates with figures in dramatic poses, most of them with architectural or landscape backdrops.
* During the 20th century, the American artist, [Jacob Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lawrence "Jacob Lawrence") created his *Vesalius Suite* based on the anatomical drawings of Andreas Vesalius.

  > "*De Fabrica* received a mixed reception when it first appeared; strict Galenists deplored its attacks on their master, while other anatomists, particularly in Italy, praised it as an important contribution—the reaction that was ultimately to carry the day," concludes Katharine Park her Commentary in the 1998 De Fabrica.
* Vesalius was going up against the towering authority of a tradition stretching back to the ancients—here specifically the work of [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") – with only his experience on his side. He knew what his eyes saw and his hands felt, and concluded that traditional belief was wrong.

  > His guarantee: if you doubt what I say and show here, do your own anatomy, see for yourself.
* Vesalius's work was also part of one of the earliest known public health programs. The Council of Doges in Venice responded to the Bubonic Plague in the mid-14th century by directing the University of Padua Medical School to devote itself to discovering the causes of plague, how it spreads, how it develops in the individual, and if possible how victims might be cured. It ultimately took three centuries to find the solution, but with Venice leading the way plague was eventually eliminated as a major killer across Europe.
