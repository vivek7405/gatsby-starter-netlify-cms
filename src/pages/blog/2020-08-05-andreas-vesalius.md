Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern [human anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy "Human anatomy"). He was born in [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels "Brussels"), which was then part of the [Habsburg Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Netherlands "Habsburg Netherlands"). He was a professor at the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua "University of Padua") and later became Imperial physician at the court of [Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor").

## Early life and education

* Vesalius was born on 31 December 1514 in Brussels, which was then part of the [Habsburg Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Netherlands "Habsburg Netherlands").
* In 1533, at Paris, he studied the theories of [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") under the guidance of [Jacques Dubois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dubois "Jacques Dubois") and [Jean Fernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Fernel "Jean Fernel"). He was often found examining excavated bones in the [charnel houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charnel_house "Charnel house") at the [Cemetery of the Innocents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimeti%C3%A8re_des_Innocents "Cimetière des Innocents").
* He completed his studies at [Leuven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuven "Leuven") and graduated. His **thesis (Treatment of individual body parts)** was a commentary on the ninth book of [Rhazes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Zakariya_al-Razi "Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi").
* He then shifted to [Venice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice "Venice") in 1536 and moved to the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua "University of Padua") to study for his [medical doctorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_doctorate "Medical doctorate"), which he received in 1537.

## Medical career and achievements

* On the day of his graduation he was immediately **offered the chair of surgery** and anatomy at [Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua "Padua"). He also **guest-lectured** at the [University of Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna "University of Bologna") and the [University of Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pisa "University of Pisa").
* He assisted [Pope Paul IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_IV "Pope Paul IV") and [Ignatius of Loyola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatius_of_Loyola "Ignatius of Loyola") to **heal people affected by [leprosy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy "Leprosy").**
* Vesalius **performed dissection as the primary teaching tool**. He considered hands-on direct observation to be the best method of learning.
* In Venice,Vesalius **published his first anatomical text, *Tabulae Anatomicae Sex***, in 1538. Then in 1539 he published an **updated version** of Winter's anatomical handbook, ***Institutiones anatomicae.***
* In 1539 he **also published his [Venesection letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Venesection_letter&action=edit&redlink=1 "Venesection letter (page does not exist)") on [bloodletting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting "Bloodletting").** This was a popular treatment for almost any illness.
* In 1543, Vesalius conducted a **public dissection** in the city of [Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel "Basel"), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland"). He assembled and articulated the bones, finally donating the [skeleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") to the [University of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel "University of Basel"). It is **still displayed at the Anatomical Museum of the [University of Basel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel "University of Basel").**

## Imperial physician and death

* Soon after publication, Vesalius became the imperial physician of the court of [Emperor Charles V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor") in Spain.
* In the 1540s, Vesalius married Anne van Hamme, from Vilvorde, Belgium. They had one daughter, named Anne, who died in 1588.
* Over the next eleven years Vesalius traveled with the court..

  * **treating injuries caused in battle or tournaments**
  * **performing postmortems &** 
  * **administering medication**
* The king Philip II (son of Charles V) rewarded him with a **pension for life** by making him a [count palatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_palatine "Count palatine").
* In 1555 he published a **revised edition of *De humani corporis fabrica*.**
* In 1564 Vesalius went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. After struggling for many days with adverse winds in the [Ionian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea "Ionian Sea"), he was shipwrecked on the island of [Zakynthos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakynthos "Zakynthos") and died at an early age of 49.

## `Publications`

### *De Humani Corporis Fabrica*

* In 1543, Vesalius published the seven-volume *[De humani corporis fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")* (T*he fabric of human body*), now referred as [Fabrica of Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica"). Vesalius was 28 years old when the first edition of *Fabrica* was published.
* During the same time, he also published *De humani corporis fabrica librorum epitome (*commonly known ***the Epitome**)*, with a stronger focus on illustrations than on text.
* His book contains drawings of several organs on two leaves and three-dimensional diagrams by cutting out the organs and pasting them on flayed figures.
* Vesalius is also the first person to describe [mechanical ventilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation "Mechanical ventilation").[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius#cite_note-Resuscitation-13)

#### Other publications

* In 1538, Vesalius wrote *Epistola, docens venam axillarem dextri cubiti in dolore laterali secandam* commonly known as the Venesection Letter.
* In 1546, three years after the *Fabrica*, he wrote his *Epistola rationem modumque propinandi radicis Chynae decocti*, commonly known as the Epistle on the China Root.

## `Scientific Findings`

### Skeletal system

* Vesalius believed the [skeletal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_system "Skeletal system") to be the framework of the human body. It was in this opening chapter or book of *[De fabrica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_humani_corporis_fabrica "De humani corporis fabrica")* that Vesalius made several of his **strongest claims against [Galen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") theories** and writings which he had put in his anatomy books. In his extensive study of the skull, Vesalius claimed that the [mandible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mandible "Human mandible") consisted of one bone, whereas Galen had thought it to be two separate bones. He accurately described the [vestibule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibule_of_the_ear "Vestibule of the ear") in the interior of the [temporal bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone "Temporal bone") of the skull.
* In [Galen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen") observation of the ape, he had discovered that their [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum "Sternum") consisted of seven parts which he assumed also held true for humans. Vesalius discovered that the [human sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum "Human sternum") consisted of only three parts.
* He also disproved the common belief that men had one rib fewer than women and noted that the [fibula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula "Fibula") and [tibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia "Tibia") bones of the leg were indeed larger than the [humerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus "Humerus") bone of the arm, unlike [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen "Galen")'s original findings.
* He very well described [sphenoid bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_bone "Sphenoid bone"). He showed that the [sternum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sternum "Human sternum") consists of three portions and the [sacrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum "Sacrum") consists of five or six portions.

### Muscular System

* Vesalius' contribution to [muscular system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_system "Muscular system") came to be known as the **"muscle men"**. He describes the **source and position of each muscle** of the body and provides information on their respective operation.

### Vascular and Circulatory Systems

* Vesalius believed that [cardiac systole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systole_(medicine) "Systole (medicine)") is synchronous with the [arterial pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(anatomy) "Pulse (anatomy)").
* He observed the valves of the [hepatic veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_veins "Hepatic veins"), and described the [vena azygos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vena_azygos "Vena azygos"). He also discovered the [ductus venosus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductus_venosus "Ductus venosus").

### Nervous System

* Vesalius defined a nerve as the mode of transmitting sensation and motion.
* He believed that the brain and the nervous system are the center of the mind and emotion.
* He also believed that nerves do not originate from the heart, but from the brain.
* Upon studying the [optic nerve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve "Optic nerve"), he discovered that nerves were not hollow.
* He gave the fullest description of the anatomy of the brain in that time.
* He did not understand the inferior recesses, and his account of the nerves is confused by regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth, and the fifth as the seventh.

### Abdominal Organs

* He described the [omentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum "Greater omentum") and its connections with the stomach, the [spleen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen "Spleen") and the [colon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy) "Colon (anatomy)").
* He gave the first correct view of the structure of the [pylorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylorus "Pylorus"), [mediastinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediastinum) and [pleura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleura "Pleura").
* Observed the small size of the caecal appendix in man.

### Heart

* He identified two chambers and two atria. The [right atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium "Right atrium") was considered a continuation of the [inferior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_vena_cava "Inferior vena cava") and [superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava "Superior vena cava") [venae cavae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae "Venae cavae"), and the [left atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_atrium "Left atrium") was considered a continuation of the [pulmonary vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_vein "Pulmonary vein").
* He also discovered that there was no hole in the [septum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septum "Septum") or [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart "Heart").

### Other Achievements

* Vesalius disproved Galen's assertion that men have more teeth than women.
* Vesalius introduced the notion of induction of the extraction of [empyema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empyema "Empyema") through surgical means.
* He also worked on medicinal remedies of treating [syphilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis "Syphilis") with [chinaroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinaroot "Chinaroot").
* Vesalius claimed that medicine had three aspects: drugs, diet, and 'the use of hands'.
* Vesalius was a supporter of 'parallel dissections' in which an animal cadaver and a human cadaver are dissected simultaneously in order to demonstrate the anatomical differences and thus correct Galenic errors.
