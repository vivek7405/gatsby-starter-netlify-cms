He was a teacher of, and collaborator with, [Edward Jenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner "Edward Jenner"), pioneer of the [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox") vaccine.

He learned anatomy by assisting his elder brother [William](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hunter_(anatomist) "William Hunter (anatomist)") with dissections in William's anatomy school in Central London, starting in 1748, and quickly became an expert in anatomy. He spent some years as an Army surgeon, worked with the dentist James Spence conducting [tooth transplants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_transplant "Tooth transplant"), and in 1764 set up his own anatomy school in London.

He built up a collection of living animals whose skeletons and other organs he prepared as anatomical specimens, eventually amassing nearly 14,000 preparations demonstrating the anatomy of humans and other [vertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrates "Vertebrates"), including 3,000+ animals.

## Early life

* Hunter was born at [Long Calderwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calderwood,_East_Kilbride "Calderwood, East Kilbride"), the youngest of ten children. The exact date of his birth is uncertain.
* Three of Hunter's siblings died of illness before he was born. An elder brother was [William Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hunter_(anatomist) "William Hunter (anatomist)"), the [anatomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomist "Anatomist").

## Education and training

* When nearly 21, he visited William in London, where his brother had become an admired teacher of anatomy. John started as his assistant in dissections (1748), and was soon running the practical classes on his own.
* Hunter heavily researched blood while [bloodletting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting "Bloodletting") patients with various diseases. This helped him develop his theory that inflammation was a bodily response to disease, and was not itself pathological.
* Hunter studied with [Marie Marguerite Bihéron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Marguerite_Bih%C3%A9ron "Marie Marguerite Bihéron"), a famous anatomist and wax modeler teaching in London; some of the illustrations in his text were likely hers.
* After qualifying, he became assistant surgeon (house surgeon) at [St George's Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George%27s_Hospital "St George's Hospital") (1756) and surgeon (1768).

## Army surgeon

* Hunter was commissioned as an Army surgeon in 1760 and was staff surgeon on expedition to the French island of [Belle Île](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_%C3%8Ele "Belle Île") in 1761, then served in 1762 with the British Army.
* Contrary to prevailing medical opinion at the time, Hunter was against the practice of 'dilation' of gunshot wounds. This practice involved the surgeon deliberately expanding a wound with the aim of making the gunpowder easier to remove.

## Post-Army career

* Hunter left the Army in 1763, and spent at least five years working in partnership with James Spence, a well-known London dentist.
* He conducted tooth transplants between living people and realized that the chances of a successful tooth transplant would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient.
* These principles are still used in the transplanation of internal organs.

### Self-experimentation

* Hunter was elected as Fellow of the [Royal Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") in 1767. At this time he was considered the leading authority on [venereal diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venereal_disease "Venereal disease"), and believed that [gonorrhea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonorrhea "Gonorrhea") and [syphilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis "Syphilis") were caused by a single pathogen.
* Living in an age when physicians frequently experimented on themselves, he was the subject of an often-repeated legend claiming that he had inoculated himself with gonorrhea, using a needle that was unknowingly contaminated with syphilis. When he contracted both syphilis and gonorrhea, he claimed it proved his erroneous theory that they were the same underlying venereal disease.

### Late career

* In 1768, Hunter was appointed as surgeon to [St George's Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George%27s_Hospital "St George's Hospital"). Later, he became a member of the [Company of Surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_of_Surgeons "Company of Surgeons"). In 1776, he was appointed surgeon to [King George III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom "George III of the United Kingdom").
* Hunter's collection is kept in the Hunterian Museum at the [Royal College of Surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England "Royal College of Surgeons of England") in London.
* In 1786, he was appointed deputy surgeon to the British Army and in March 1790, he was made [surgeon general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon-General_(United_Kingdom) "Surgeon-General (United Kingdom)") by the then Prime Minister, [William Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pitt_the_Younger "William Pitt the Younger").
* Hunter's death in 1793 was due to a heart attack brought on by an argument at St George's Hospital concerning the admission of students. He was originally buried at [St Martin-in-the-Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Martin-in-the-Fields "St Martin-in-the-Fields"), but in 1859 was reburied in the north aisle of the nave in [Westminster Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey "Westminster Abbey"), reflecting his importance to the country.

## Family

* In 1771, he married [Anne Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Home "Anne Home"), daughter of Robert Boyne Home and sister of Sir [Everard Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everard_Home "Everard Home").
* They had four children, two of whom died before the age of five.

## Legacy

* In 1799, the government purchased Hunter's collection of papers and specimens, which it presented to the Company of Surgeons.
